These templates were copied from the Flask app.
You may need to update:
- url_for(...) -> {% url 'name' %} in links and forms
- flashed messages -> Django messages (already wired)
- form rendering: replace Flask-WTF fields with Django form tags (views supply 'form')

Start pages wired:
index.html, awareness.html, login.html, register.html, report_anonymous.html, submit_report.html, report_success.html.
